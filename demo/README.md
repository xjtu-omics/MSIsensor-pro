# Quick start with MSIsensor-pro


We use Snakemake here to test all the commands of msisensor-pro.
Users only need to install snakemake and then modify the
value of the variable msisensor_pro in the Snakefile
to the absolute path of msisensor-pro on their own device.
After that, they can run this demo directly using Snakemake.

 ```
 cd /path/to/msisensor-pro/demo
 snakemake -j
 ```
